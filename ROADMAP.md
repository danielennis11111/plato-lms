# Roadmap - User Management & Enhanced Discussions

## Branch: feature/user-management-and-discussions

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objectives

#### 1. Multi-User Account System
- **User Registration/Login**: Allow multiple users to create accounts and manage their own profiles
- **Personal API Keys**: Each user can store their own Gemini API key securely
- **User Isolation**: Separate chat histories, course progress, and settings per user
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with customizable learning preferences
- **Session Management**: Proper authentication and session handling

#### 2. Enhanced Discussion Experience
- **AI Discussion Simulation**: Improve chat experience on discussion pages to better simulate real classroom discussions
- **Dynamic Conversation Flow**: AI continues discussions naturally based on recent comments and context
- **Personality-Driven Responses**: Enhance the six student personality types with more realistic dialogue patterns
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI understands discussion topic, course context, and conversation history
- **Real-time Discussion**: Simulate live discussion environments with multiple AI "students"

#### 3. Comprehensive Mock Discussion Content
- **Expanded Discussion Topics**: Create diverse discussion threads for different courses and subjects
- **Rich Thread Content**: Detailed posts, replies, and sub-conversations for each discussion
- **Cross-Course Discussions**: Discussion topics that span multiple courses and disciplines
- **Realistic Engagement**: Varied response times, discussion depths, and engagement levels
- **Student Interaction Patterns**: Authentic conversation flows between different personality types

3. **Conversation Flow Management**
   - [ ] Natural discussion progression algorithms
   - [ ] Conflict and agreement simulation
   - [ ] Question generation to keep discussions active
   - [ ] Summary and conclusion capabilities

#### Phase 3: Rich Discussion Content
1. **Mock Discussion Database**
   - [ ] Comprehensive discussion topics for each course
   - [ ] Varied discussion types (debates, collaborative projects, Q&A, case studies)
   - [ ] Historical discussion archives
   - [ ] Trending topics and popular discussions

2. **Dynamic Content Generation**
   - [ ] AI-generated discussion starters
   - [ ] Procedural conversation branches
   - [ ] Context-sensitive follow-up questions
   - [ ] Real-world case study integration

3. **Engagement Simulation**
   - [ ] Realistic posting schedules and patterns
   - [ ] Varied engagement levels (lurkers, active participants, leaders)
   - [ ] Discussion moderation simulation
   - [ ] Peer feedback and rating systems
