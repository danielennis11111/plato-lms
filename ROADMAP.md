# Roadmap - Canvas API Integration & Enhanced AI Dialogues

## Branch: feature/user-management-and-discussions

### üèóÔ∏è **Revised Architecture: Canvas + Gemini Integration**

Instead of building custom user management, we're leveraging existing Canvas LMS infrastructure:

- **Canvas API**: User authentication, course data, assignments, discussions
- **Personal Gemini Keys**: Each user provides their own API key for AI features
- **Focus**: Socratic AI enhancement as value-add to existing LMS
- **Demo Mode**: Full functionality without Canvas connection for showcasing

### üöÄ Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- Git for version control

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielennis11111/plato-lms.git
cd plato-lms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```
